== 1.1 Requirements Overview

=== Primary Goal

Clicky is a CLI-based kanban board tool designed to facilitate collaboration between human users and coding agents (AI assistants, scripts, automation tools). The primary goal is to provide a simple, text-based interface for task management that works seamlessly in both interactive and automated contexts.
